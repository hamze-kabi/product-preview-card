## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sassy css
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Using link tag to implement fonts instead of using the font file locally.
- Isolated variables in _variables.scss and mixins in _mixins.scss, this act made commitment to DRY more fluid and and the code more readable.
